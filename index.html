            <h3>The Dream</h3>
                <p>Like most kids, I grew up watching cartoons when my mother had nothing else for me to do or when she'd leave me to my own devices. In the mornings, she would drop my younger sister and I off at summer camp geared towards younger kids (we were almost 7 years apart) while she worked as an OR nurse. I remember having breakfast cereal out of small rectangular box full of sugar and watching Sailor Moon before the sun even came up. This cartoon was different. It was pretty and fantastical. Not like Bugs Bunny or the jagged lines of American cartoons at the time. Usagi Moon was my first introduction to anime. As I grew older, I wanted to find more. Lo and behold, Cartoon Network created Toonami as the growing number of audiences fell in love with anime at the same time I did and it became far more accessible. Then it was manga. Then it was anime conventions. Then it became college courses of Japanese culture and religion. I developed this want not just to visit Japan, but to live there. I wanted to know what it would be like to breathe the air, to walk and know the people, to visit the mountains and forests and understand what it meant to <italic>"shinrin-yoku"</italic> or forest bathing. I received my degree in English, worked on a TEFL certificate, contacted a friend living in Japan who helped recruit me to a teaching position at her school on the outskirts of metropolitan Tokyo. This whole journey took 7 years. But I kept moving towards it, inching bit by bit, telling my friends and family repeatedly, "I'm going to Japan..", "When I leave to Japan..", etc. It didn't matter to me whether they believed me, I knew that I would end up there. Finally, I did. </p>
